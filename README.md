# ciphers
 
## affine cipher
The affine cipher is a type of monoalphabetic substitution cipher, where each letter in an alphabet is mapped to its numeric equivalent, encrypted using a simple mathematical function, and converted back to a letter [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affine_cipher)

## atbash cipher
The Atbash cipher is a cipher where in the alphabet is mapped in reverse so the first letter becomes the last letter, the second becomes the second to last and so on. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atbash)

## autokey cipher
The autokey cipher is a ciphere where each letter in plaintext is mapped to the [tabula recta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tabula_recta) using a key wod or phrase [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autokey_cipher)

## baconian cipher
The Baconian cipher is a type of mesage encoding wherea as each letter of the plaintext is replaced by a group of five letters consisting of either 'a' or 'b'. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacon%27s_cipher)

## caesar cipher
The Caesar cipher is a type of substitution cipher where each letter is replaced by another letter a fixed number of positions away in the alphabet. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesar_cipher)

## hill cipher
The hill cipher is a substitution cipher based on linear alebra, each letter is first mapped to a number (0-25) then is seperated into blocks, multiplied by a matrix key, mod 26 is taken. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hill_cipher) 
**work in progress**

## rail-fence cipher
The rail-fence cipher is a type of transposition cipher. Each letter is taken and written in a zig zag fashion based on a numerical key, for example a message of 'hello there' with a key of 3 could be transposed as so:
/
h . . . o . . . r . \
. e . l . t . e . e \
. . l . . . h . . . \
/
which is then read from left to right providing the following ciphertext: 'horelteelh'

## ROT13 cipher
The ROT13 is a simple cipher similar to the caesar cipher except instead of a variable key each letter is replaced by the letter 13 places ahead of it [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ROT13)

## substitution cipher
A simple substitution cipher is a cipher where each letter of an alphabet is replaced by a different letter of the alphabet provided by a key. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substitution_cipher)
